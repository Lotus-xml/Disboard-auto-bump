# Hey femboy!

This little script automatically bumps your server so you never have to worry about using disboard manually again.

## Usage

You will need to install nodejs and npm first. Ask ChatGPT or google if you don't know how.
Run npm install discord-js-selfbot and then you can simply run `nodejs main.js`

To have the script running 24/7 you can use a vps or even replit (JUST REMEMBER NOT TO EXPOSE YOUR ACCOUNT TOKEN!)
